       Hello! I am Yousif, a mechanical engineer at heart with a passion for robotics. My master's thesis at the Robotics Research Lab in the TU Kaiserslautern focused on leveraging
       Unreal Engine for Simulation-in-the-Loop based training of RL agents to achieve meaningful sim2real transfer, where various frameworks, reward settings and observations are tuned. 
       My interests include 3D Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Control Theory/Dynamical Systems and Reinforcement Learning.

          Migration from YOLOv3 + Keras runtime to YOLOv7 + ONNX runtime, modifying the pipeline for better performance. Training and detailed evaluation
          and comparison between the 2 pipelines. Deployment.
          *Accomplishments*: Labeled Training data, trained YOLOv7 and carried out a detailed evaluation to consolidate the increase of performance
          (accuracy, precision & recall) beteween the old and new pipeline. The tool is staged, tested and live as of 28.08.2023

          Proof of Concept and Know-How using Stereo-vision generated data and Deep Learning to position and classify objects 
          for a logistik-arm manipulator. Dataset generation, labeling and best approach investigation.
          *Accomplishments*: Applied and modified 2 state-of-the-art 3D CV class algorithms, one that consumes pointclouds directly 
          as well as techniques that are based on 2D CV and leverages pointclouds to estimate the position.
