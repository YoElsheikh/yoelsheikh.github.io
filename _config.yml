          Proof of Concept and Know-How using Stereovision generated and Deep Learning data to position and classify objects 
          for a logistig-arm manipulator.
          Accomplishments: Applied and modified 2 state-of-the-art 3D CV class algorithms, one that consumes pointclouds directly 
          as well as techniques that are based on 2D CV and leverages pointclouds to estimate the position.

          Application of the iterative linear quadratic regulator for path planning for a simple model of a mobile robot
          Accomplishments: Successfully applied the controller, which is the first of its kind in the chair for Electromobility at TU Kaiserslautern
          securing a 1,0.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Detailed mathematical modelling of the IPS (Inverted Pendulum System) and leveraging the Genetic Algorithm to determine the components that
          minimize the cost function of the LQR to stabalize the non-linear IPS.
          Accomplishments: Successfully applied the controller and carried out a comparison against fine-tuned LQR considering the performance and energy
          consumption.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
