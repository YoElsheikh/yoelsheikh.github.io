          Proof of Concept and Know-How using Stereo-vision generated data and Deep Learning to position and classify objects 
          for a logistik-arm manipulator.
          *Accomplishments*: Applied and modified 2 state-of-the-art 3D CV class algorithms, one that consumes pointclouds directly 
          as well as techniques that are based on 2D CV and leverages pointclouds to estimate the position.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Detailed mathematical modelling of the IPS (Inverted Pendulum System) and leveraging the Genetic Algorithm to determine the components that
          minimize the cost function of the LQR to stabalize the non-linear IPS.
          *Accomplishments*: Successfully applied the controller and carried out a comparison against fine-tuned LQR considering the performance and energy
          consumption.
